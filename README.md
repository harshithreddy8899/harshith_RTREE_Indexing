# harshith_RTREE_Indexing
In order to handle spatial data efficiently, as required in computer aided design and
geo-data applications, a database system needs an mdex mechanism that ti help it
retrieve data items quickly accordmg to their spatial locations However, traditional
mdexmg methods are not well suited to data oblects of non-zero size located m multi-
dimensional spaces In this paper we describe a dynarmc mdex structure called an R-tree
winch meets this need, and give algorithms for searching and updatmg it. We present the
results of a series of tests which indicate that the structure performs well, and conclude
that it is useful for current database systems m spatial applications.
